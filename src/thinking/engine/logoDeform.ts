// destroy a logo. A sphere reads correctly from every angle and has no

 * metaphor was right and the object was wrong: every other state here is a
 * solid turning in space, and a flat panel read as a chart that had
 * wandered in. The second kept the crystal but kept the noise too, and the
 * noise ran on its own clock , so the mark would arrive, leave, and a cloud
 * of scattered dots would snap into being from nowhere.
 *
 * There is no noise now. The form is always the crystal; what changes is
 * how much of it has been WORKED. Unstitched dots sit dim and neutral
 * grey, stitched ones carry full ink and the brand's colour, and the head
 * travelling between them is the brightest thing on screen. Generation as
 * something being made, rather than something appearing.
 *
 * The stitch order is the Fibonacci index itself, which walks the lattice
 * from pole to pole in a spiral , so the head sweeps row after row without
 * needing an ordering computed for it.
 *
 * The unravel matters as much as the stitch. On the way back from the mark
 * the work undoes itself, so the cycle reaches its own start already dark
 * rather than resetting there. Every version that reset at the boundary
 * popped, and a pop is exactly what this whole cycle was reshaped to
 * remove.
